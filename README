make-acme-kernel.sh
4 MARCH 2012

This is a bash script that automates the process of creating a kernel for the ACME Systems Fox G20.

It is configured for kernel 3.2.8 but may be easily changed for different versions.

Patches are provided by dougg and ACME Systems.

There are two .config file options.  One, provided by me, enables all available serial ports on the G20.  
Another, by dougg, has fewer options enabled.  Of course, you can change the kernel options when the make config
step happens, early in the build process.

This script was built and tested under Ubuntu 11.10.  It may work just fine with other distributions and environments, but
has not been widely tested.  Of course, building a kernel for the G20 will require installation of the cross-compiler
environment and toolchain.  See this article for more: www.acmesystems.it/arm9_toolchain
